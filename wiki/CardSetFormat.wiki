#summary How to build a card set.

== Introduction ==

In ShoddyTCG, Databases are written in pure, raw XML. 
Due to the different card types that any given Pokemon Card can be, this guide will be split into several sections. 


== The Card Set ==

The Card Set XML must be placed in the res/sets folder, with a short name, like dp.xml, where dp is the set's codename. 

The following is a table with the Set's name and its Codename, ordered by release date. 
|| Set Name || Code ||
|| Diamond and Pearl || DP ||
|| Mysterious Treasures	|| MT ||
|| OP Series 6 || OP6 || 
|| Secret Wonders || SW ||
|| DP Trainer Kit 1 || TK3 ||
|| Great Encounters || GE ||
|| OP Series 7 || OP7 ||
|| Majestic Dawn || MD ||
|| Legends Awakened || LA ||
|| OP Series 8 || OP8 ||
|| Stormfront || SF ||
|| Platinum || PL ||
|| Rising Rivals || RR ||
|| OP Series 9 || OP9 ||
|| Supreme Victors || SV ||
|| Arceus || AR ||
|| DP Promos || NDP ||

A sample cardset is provided below. 
{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<cardset code="DP">
	<card>
		...
	</card>
	<card>
		...
	</card>
	<card>
		...
	</card>
</cardset>
}}}

== Template ==
When making a card use this template. It will make it easier to keep everything organised with the spaces and to spot errors.

{{{
    <card>
        <id></id>
        <uniqueName></uniqueName>
        <name></name>
        <pokemon>
            <hp></hp>
            <type></type>
            <stage></stage>  
            <prestage></prestage>   
            <attack>
                <name></name>
                <cost></cost>
                <damage></damage>
                <text></text>
            </attack>
            <attack>
                <name></name>
                <cost></cost>
                <damage></damage>
                <text></text>
            </attack>
            <weakness></weakness>
            <resistance></resistance>
            <retreat></retreat>
            </pokemon>
        <rarity></rarity>
        <illustration></illustration>
    </card>
}}}

When a Poke-Power or Poke-Body is used on the card change

{{{
<attack> and </attack>
to
<pokebody> or <pokepower> and </pokebody> or </pokepower>
Also take away the cost and damage tags.
}}}
